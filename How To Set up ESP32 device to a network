Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting an ESP32 Device to a Network

Step 1: Set Up Arduino IDE

Download and install Arduino IDE from the official website.
Open Arduino IDE and go to "File" > "Preferences."
Add the ESP32 board manager URL: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
Click "OK" to save preferences.

Step 2: Install ESP32 Board Package

Navigate to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager..."
Search for "esp32" and install the latest version.
Select ESP32 board from "Tools" > "Board" menu.

Step 3: Set Up Wi-Fi Credentials

Open Arduino IDE and go to "File" > "Examples" > "ESP32" > "WiFi" > "WiFiScan."
Modify code with your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
Upload code to ESP32 board.

Step 4: Establish Wi-Fi Connection

Navigate to "File" > "Examples" > "ESP32" > "WiFi" > "WiFiClient."
Modify code with your Wi-Fi credentials.
Upload code to ESP32 board.

Step 5: Verify Connection

Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud rate) in Arduino IDE.
Observe ESP32 connecting to Wi-Fi network and obtaining IP address.

Step 6: Test with Basic Example

Navigate to "File" > "Examples" > "ESP32" > "WiFi" > "WiFiClient" > "WiFiClientBasic."
Upload code to ESP32 board.
Open Serial Monitor and monitor ESP32's attempt to connect to a server.
Your ESP32 device is now connected to the network, opening doors to various IoT applications.
